# PDF Splitter
- Used for spliting the single long sized pdf into multiple pages (in A4s)
- Can be used after exporting a long pdf.
- GUI Powered by Tkinter

## Why Do I use this?
- I use (Excalidraw)[https://excalidraw.com] for my handwritten notes I make for my university
- It's very frustrating to export it as a pdf. I used to export it as a svg and convert lotta things
- But now due to this i just export the svg, and then convert it into pdf and later run this python script and in seconds it's done!

## Requirements
- Fitz - For the PyMuPDF
- reportlan.libpagesizes - for the page size (specifially the a0 size)
- tkinter - for the filedialog (for file navigation)
